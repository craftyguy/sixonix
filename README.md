SIXONIX
=======

Sixonix is a set of scripts which enable the user to run various benchmarks with
the intention of benchmarking different GPU drivers. It is similar in nature to
[Phoronix Test Suite](https://github.com/phoronix-test-suite/phoronix-test-suite). In fact, if you want benchmarking tools for yourself to work out of the box, that is a much better project for several reasons.

Sixonix is a very barebones set of scripts. It requires a lot of user
intervention.
